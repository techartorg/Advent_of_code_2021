# Advent of Code 2021

Once again, for the 2021 version of Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com), the global Technical Artist Community is putting their various solutions online for critique, ridicule, discussion, and most importantly, learning!

If you would like to contibute your solutions please join the global Technical Artist Slack channel (http://tech-artists.slack.com/) and/or our community forums at https://www.tech-artists.org

Remember, please don't upload your inputs, everyone gets something different, so the idea is to find general solutions that work for anyone's input.
